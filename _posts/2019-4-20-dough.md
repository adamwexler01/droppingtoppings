Before you learn to Drop Topps, you must make the dough. Then you can learn how to throw the dough. Then you can learn to Drop Topps. This recipe makes five dough balls for 12-14 inch pizzas or perhaps three of those and a Sicilian pizza. I normally use one or two dough balls right away and freeze the others in ziplock bags.

# Total Ingredients (makes 4-6 dough balls)
- 4-5 cups of flour
- water
- 1 packet yeast
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil

## Step One: [Poolish](https://www.google.com/search?q=poolish&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS717US717&oq=poolish&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.166555j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
- 1 cup flour
- 1 cup water
- 1 packet yeast

Mix together yeast and water. Slowly mix in flour to minimize lumps. Mix until smooth.

Cover with a lid and refrigerate overnight.

I use [these bowls](https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-CTG-00-SMB-Stainless-Steel-Mixing/dp/B004YZEO9K/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3RT69OTGXUXO5&keywords=cusinart+bowls+with+lids&qid=1558852416&s=gateway&sprefix=cusinart+bowls%2Caps%2C183&sr=8-3) because they have lids. If you poured your flour in too quickly and your poolish is lumpy, you can take it out of the refrigerator and stir it every so often to reduce that. Hopefully it looks like this:

### Step Two: Make Dough
- 3 cups flour
- 1 cup water
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil  
- salt

Pour 1 cup of water into a mixing bowl. Add a sprinkle of salt and the olive oil. Stir until the salt dissolves a little. Slowly mix in one cup of flour. I like to tap my mixing spoon up against the cup to knock a little flour in a little at a time.

Lumpy dough is annoying to try to get unlumpy... so just add the dough *slowly* so it never gets lumpy. Your dough should look similar to your poolish which you have now pulled out of the refrigerator.

Mix the poolish into the dough. Once combined, slowly continue to add your second cup of flour slowly. The dough will begin to thicken and get really sticky. Once your mixing spoon is getting annoyingly sticky, it's time to take a break before switching to your hands. Dust the dough with flour. Cover the bowl with a towel or with the lid placed on top unsealed.

Dust your hands with flour. Do it over the dough so the leftover flour just falls on to it.

Scoop your third cup of flour. Your goal is now to slowly add flour until the dough feels like silk and moves well in your hands without sticking to them. Dust the dough with flour so the surface feels smooth. Push the flour into the dough, kneading it in the bowl until it's sticky again. Repeat these steps until the dough doesn't stick to your hands and you can pick it up. It should take 2/3 - 3/4 of your cup of flour.

Now that you can pick the dough up, continue to add the flour the same way. Instead of kneading you'll begin to tuck the dough into itself. Continue this process until your dough isn't sticky. You may need up to another full cup of flour depending on how much has stuck to your mixing bowl and ended up on the counter.

When you're satisfied with the texture and elasticity of your dough, leave it covered in the bowl again for a few minutes so it settles.

## Step Three: Divvy up Dough
Take this large dough ball to a baking sheet and cut it into 4-6 smaller balls.
