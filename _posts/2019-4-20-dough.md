Before you learn to Drop Topps, you must make the dough. Then you can learn how to throw the dough. Then you can learn to Drop Topps. This recipe makes five dough balls for 12-14 inch pizzas or perhaps three of those and a Sicilian pizza. I normally use one or two dough balls right away and freeze the others in ziplock bags.

# Total Ingredients
### makes 4-6 dough balls
- 4-5 cups of flour
- water
- 1 packet yeast
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil

## Step One: [Poolish](https://www.google.com/search?q=poolish&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS717US717&oq=poolish&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.166555j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
- 1 cup flour
- 1 cup water
- 1 packet yeast

Mix together yeast and water. Slowly mix in flour to minimize lumps. Mix until smooth. Cover with a lid and refrigerate overnight. I use [these bowls](https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-CTG-00-SMB-Stainless-Steel-Mixing/dp/B004YZEO9K/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3RT69OTGXUXO5&keywords=cusinart+bowls+with+lids&qid=1558852416&s=gateway&sprefix=cusinart+bowls%2Caps%2C183&sr=8-3) because they have lids. If you poured your flour in too quickly and your poolish is lumpy, you can take it out of the refrigerator and stir it every so often to reduce that. Hopefully it looks like this:

## Step Two: Make Dough
- 3 cups flour
- 1 cup water
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil  
- salt

Pour 1 cup of water into a mixing bowl. Add a sprinkle of salt and the olive oil. Stir until the salt dissolves a little. Slowly mix in one cup of flour. I like to tap my mixing spoon up against the cup to knock a little flour in a little at a time. Lumpy dough is annoying to try to get unlumpy... so just add the dough slowly so it never gets lumpy. After a cup and a half of flour your dough should look similar to your poolish which you have now pulled out of the refrigerator.

Mix the poolish into the dough. Once combined, slowly continue to add more flour slowly. The dough will begin to thicken and get really sticky. Your goal is to slowly add flour until the dough feels like silk and moves well in your hands without sticking to anything. First, cover your hands in flour. Do it over the dough so the leftover flour just falls on to it.

Dust the dough with flour, push it into the dough until it's sticky again. Repeat these steps until the dough doesn't stick to your hands and you can pick it up. You should have added about 2 cups of flour since you added the poolish. If the dough is still a little sticky, dust it with more flour and fold the dough into itself.

## Step Three: Divvy up Dough
Take this large dough ball to a baking sheet and cut it into 4-6 smaller balls.
