# Learning In Progress
Ashes, Pencil Shavings is a learning experience disguised as a music video. In making it I was able to learn new techniques for software I regularly use for work as well as learn new software. [Check out the automated webstore I launched along with the video to get limited edition merch!](/shop/)

### Software Used
- FL Studio music composition
- Blender 3D modeling and animation
- Adobe After Effects 2D modeling and animation
- Adobe Premiere Pro video editing
- Adobe Illustrator 2D graphics
- Adobe Photoshop
- Hands on camera work

In launching the webstore, I...
- implemented AWS lambda backend services for RESTful calls
- wrote my own API for returning secure responses from vendors
- consumed API and webhooks from Snipcart, Printful and Paypal
- made some sweet soft hoodies
