# Hello World!

Hey there! I'm Damien, but you can call me Damo if you prefer. I graduated from University of Florida with a Computer Engineering: Digital Arts and Sciences degree in 2015.

Damos Designs was first founded as a T-Shirt/promotional product design company in 2012. After two years of sales, shipping 200+ designs across the country, my focus shifted to software in addition to digital art.

I have experience in building Virtual Reality experiences, 3D modeling assets, 3D printing prototypes, developing end to end Chrome Extensions, Chromecast Applications, Android Applications, Android for Auto, Android Wear, building custom high end computers, mining cryptocurrency, and creating multidimensional digital art.

Thanks for visiting my website. Hopefully I was able to teach you something new or inspire you to start your next project.

I'm always looking for exciting new projects. If you need help bringing your ideas to life, reach out from any of the ways on my [Contact](/contact/) page. I'd be happy to help!
